    A uniform REST API for client-server communication. 

    All request parameters can be passed as a set of query parameters, a JSON object with properties, or as a web form. In the latter cases, each documented query parameter can be passed as a JSON object's property or as a form field respectively.

    Authentication is performed using the standard Authorization header with the "SessionID" scheme (and the "Bearer"/token scheme later).

        Checks if a file or folder has certain capabilities or permits certain operations. The endpoint is used to query heavyweight properties of an item that should not be returned in a regular listing due to the high computational cost.

        A query should contain one or several capabilities (several values are separated with a comma).

        The following capabilities can be queried:
        * writePermissions - the user has write permissions on the specified file.
        * folderAccessible - the specified folder is accessible to the user

        If `createContent` is specified and the file extension (specified either in `name` or `extension`) is recognized, the file is pre-populated with content according to the extension.

        A simpler form of search with just one field being searched. To specify more fields, use the POST form of this endpoint.

        The `fieldName` parameter indicates where to search. The possible values are
        * `path` : the path of a file or folder with a name and an extension
        * `name` : just the name of a file or folder (with an extension)
        * `ext` : just the extension
        * `date-created` : the creation date of a file or directory
        * `date-modified` : the last modification date of a file or directory
        * `type` : `f` or `d` for files and folders respectively
        * `size` : the size of a file
        * `content` : file content

        The `query` parameter contains the search pattern or condition to apply to the field depennding on what the value of `fieldName` is:
        * For `path`, `name`, `ext`, and `content`, the value of `query` is searched with a substring search, case-insensitively. 
        * For `date-created` and `date-modified`, `query` may contain an ISO8601-formatted string representation of one date that specifies the exact date value (the time component is ignored and the whole day from 0:00 of the date to 0:00 of the next date is counted), or the range of values "from-to" with the lower and upper values included, or just one of the boundaries. For ranges, the time component of the date is taken into account. 
        * For `type`, set `query` to either `f` for files or `d` for folders. 
        * For `size`, `query` may contain a string representation of one number that specifies the exact value, or the range of values "from-to" with the lower and upper values included, or just one of the boundaries, e.g., "100-" or "-200".

        Identifies how the server should handle name conflicts that occur when performing an operation in which an item with the same name or Id already exists.

        Note about `replace`-ment: a directory can replace a file, but a file cannot replace a directory; also, when an existing file is replaced, deletion may fail, in which case, replacing will still fail with status code 409 Conflict. 

        The `ignore` value means that even if the target filename exists, the name check function will return success; in most cases, this will lead to the failure of the subsequent operation or to the effect the same as replace. However, when making a ZIP file, this value will lead to new files being added to the existing archive if one exists.
